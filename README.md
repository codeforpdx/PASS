Welcome! üëãüëãüèøüëãüèΩüëãüèªüëãüèæüëãüèº

PASS is an open source digital wallet for providing home insecure individuals a safe place to store documents within their control. PASS additionally aims to assist caseworkers with processing and providing documents needed to complete the housing assistance application process.

The [PASS wiki](https://github.com/codeforpdx/PASS/wiki) contains detailed information of all things PASS including contribution guidelines, tech stack, information on SOLID, ect...

PASS is currently in development working towards MVP release by generous efforts from [our contributors](https://github.com/codeforpdx/PASS/graphs/contributors

## 1. Setup Instructions

- ### Prerequisites

  Currently we require Node version 16.20.2 and NPM for our package manager. We recommend managing node and npm using Node Version Manager (NVM). To do so:

1. Download NVM for your system.

- For Mac, Linux, and other POSIX users: https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm
- For Windows users: https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows

2. Install node version 16.20.2:
   ```
   nvm install 16.20.2
   ```
3. Use that node version:
   ```
   nvm use 16.20.2
   ```
4. Check that node and npm are set up:
   ```
   node -v
   npm -v
   ```
   If either of those commands error, node has not been installed correctly.

- ### Clone and Install Dependencies

1. Clone the git repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/codeforpdx/PASS.git
   ```
2. Install project dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
3. Install the pre-commmit prettier, linter, and test hooks. 
   ```
   npm run prepare
   ```
4. Run the project: 
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```
5. PASS should launch at `http://localhost:5173`. You can now visit that url, and sign into a pod hosted at the OIDC provider of your choice.

- ### Setting up a Development Pod Server
  PASS is able to connect to any solid-spec compliant pod server. However, for testing, it's recommended that you run a server locally. PASS provides tools to make this easy to do.

1. Clone and install dependencies. [See previous section](#clone-and-install-dependencies)

2. In the project's root directory, copy the `env.template` file into a `.env` file. In bash you can use this command:

   ```bash
   cp env.template .env
   ```

3. Run `npm run podserver` to launch the pod server. The server will begin listening on `http://localhost:3000`, and will create a folder in the PASS project folder called `local_temp_server_files`. You can find all server and pod files there.

4. Open a browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`. You should encounter a screen asking you to set up the server and create an account. Create your first account, and your server will be ready for development.

5. Launch PASS with `npm run dev`. Click the `Login` button on the home page. If everything has been set up right, you should be redirected to your local pod server to finish login.

Note: The `npm run podserver` command will launch a server that stores documents on your local file system. If you don't want to store documents, and want all server data to be deleted on shutdown, you can run `npm run podserver:temp`

## 2. Project Overview

In Portland, housing insecure individuals struggle to maintain documents often required to receive government and/or non-profit services. With PASS, we are building out an application to enable housing insecure individuals to store their personal documents in decentralized data stores, called Pods. PASS will also provide a platform for Organizations to assist with providing and processing documents required for housing assistance. Using [Solid Data Pods](https://solidproject.org/) individuals will have control over which organizations and applications can access their data. Verified organizations will be able to use PASS to request data from an individual and/or add documents (such as references or invoices) to an individuals pod to help process housing assistance applications.

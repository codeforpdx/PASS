# Welcome to PASS!

## Project summary

Building out a decentralized application to enable house insecure individuals to securely store their documents electronically. Verified organizations seeking documentation from individuals will utilize PASS to request and review documents from individuals, as well as share documents with individuals. Individuals will need to grant permission to organizations before they can access documents.

## Get started

1. Join [Code for PDX Discord](https://discord.gg/FEX9KUMH). If you run into any issues, shoot an email to our CodeForPDX brigade leader, Hugh: Hugh@codeforpdx.org
2. Post your GitHub name in the [**#github-access-request**](https://discord.com/channels/1068260532806766733/1078124139983945858) channel and we’ll add you to our [GitHub](https://github.com/codeforpdx/PASS). Even if you don't plan or writing code for the project, please have Hugh get you connected to our GitHub. We keep track of technical and non-technical tasks in GitHub Projects.
3. Introduce yourself and post your email in the [**#pass**](https://discord.com/channels/1068260532806766733/1075285803137257544) channel so we can add you to our [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1zTEd34K7Eg7rvg71zS6Uzbwrsct2Lx9E?ths=true). You can send that info to Flo privately if you're more comfortable with that. 
4. Our project is broken into three teams: UX/UI, Project Management, and Developers (back and front end). We are currently meeting in separate groups based on team member availability. The development team meets virtually every Tuesday at 7pm via Google Meet.
5. Reach out to Flo (Project Manager) on slack to introduce yourself and share how you wish to contribute.


## Ready to contribute?

1. Get our github project cloned to your local computer in whatever IDE you prefer. If you are new to Git/GitHub, I have links to learn more as you go. You can also check out [this article](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-create-a-pull-request-on-github) for a broad overview.
  * Open terminal
  * Change working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory.
  * `git clone https://github.com/codeforpdx/PASS.git` [learn more](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository?platform=linux)
  * `git remote add origin https://github.com/codeforpdx/PASS.git` [learn more](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/getting-started-with-git/managing-remote-repositories)
2. Once you have PASS cloned to your local system, read the [React Documentation](/docs/README.md). Follow the instructions to open JSDocs and review Forms, hooks, utils and solid_identity_provider tabs. This will give you a great initial breakdown of the project functions.
3. Feel free to [`git checkout jk/solidTests`](https://github.com/codeforpdx/PASS/tree/jk/solidTests). If you notice a gap or errors in documentation feel free to make the changes locally and create a pull request to the branch creator.


## Our development process

1. Follow step one under **Ready to contribute?**
2. Create a new branch to work on your feature:
  * `git checkout -b <branch name>` [learn more](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/using-branches/git-checkout)
3. `git pull origin Development` - to sync with PASS Development branch
4. Work on feature in your own branch.
5. When ready, push up for review:
  * `git push origin <your branch name>`
6. Make a [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/requesting-a-pull-request-review) to Development branch. Request reviews from members of the team - you’ll need their approval to merge. **Make sure to close your branch once merged.

- Good people to ask for reviews:
  - Development -- Jared Krajewski, Ka Hung, Kevin M., Greg Witt
  - Documentation -- Danica, Flo(rian)
- When in doubt, ask more people for reviews!
- Include screenshots whenever you’re building a frontend feature.

7. If you are new to GitHub and/or the team, feel free to make your first pull request on the README/Contributing documentation to familiarize yourself with the project and GitHub. Add any comments and/or feedback. Request reviews from the appropriate people above.

## Feeling Lost?
Our developers will occasionally hang out in the *#pass voice channel* on Discord while working on the project. If you ever see people in there, feel free to hop in and ask questions. Consider it office hours.

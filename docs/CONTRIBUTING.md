## 1. Project summary

PASS is a decentralized application aiming to enable home insecure individuals to electronically securely store their documents. Verified organizations seeking documentation from individuals will utilize PASS to request and review documents from individuals, as well as share documents with individuals. Individuals will need to grant permission to organizations before they can access documents allowing them to always remain in control of their data.

## 5. Development Process

- ## Choosing an Issue
  
1. Search through open [issues](https://github.com/codeforpdx/PASS/issues).
2. Find an issue that interests you.
3. Check if someone is currently working on that issue and if a [pull request](https://github.com/codeforpdx/PASS/pulls) exists.
4. Assign yourself to issue and leave a comment stating your intentions.
  
- ## Clone the repo

1. Clone repo to local environment in IDE of choice. If you are new to Git/GitHub you can also check out [this article](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-create-a-pull-request-on-github) for a broad overview.
   - Open terminal & change working directory to the location you want the repository cloned to.
   - `git clone https://github.com/codeforpdx/PASS.git` [learn more about git clone](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository?platform=linux)
   - `git remote add origin https://github.com/codeforpdx/PASS.git` [learn more about git remote](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/getting-started-with-git/managing-remote-repositories)

2. Setup instructions to locally run PASS can be found in the [readme](../README.md).

3. Create a new branch to work on your feature:
    - `git checkout -b <your branch name> Development` [learn more about git branches](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/using-branches/git-checkout) using the recommended naming convention `issue-\<number\>/\<branch name\>` 
      > Example: `issue-112/delete-client-modal`
    - `git pull origin Development` - to sync with PASS Development branch
    - This can also be done directly from an issue in GitHub.

2. When ready, push to GitHub

 - `git push origin <your branch name>`

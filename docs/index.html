<h2>PASS Project - React Migration Test</h2>
<p>This repository branch contains a ported version of the PASS project using React. Currently, this build can:</p>
<ol>
<li>Log into a user's Pod</li>
<li>Upload files through a form and store them in the user's Pod</li>
<li>Query for specific document from user's Pod if file exist (i.e. .ttl file exist for specific document type)</li>
<li>Delete specific document from user's Pod if file exist (i.e. .ttl file exist for specific document type)</li>
<li>Logout the user</li>
</ol>
<p>Newer features like Cross Pod interactions for querying and/or writing new files has yet to be implemented. However, components for these features are present as placeholders at this time (Feb 18, 2023).</p>
<h2>State of Build</h2>
<p>The current build is made with React 18 and bundled with Parcel v2. As of Feb 18, 2023, the solid-ui-react library has been incorporated to the application along with Solid's other client libraries. CSS class names and id are lightly modified in JSX to accommodate for React and CSS-in-JS features (primarily React's style attribute) has been included. The existing CSS file has also been lightly modified to use font family Arial as default.</p>
<p>Documentation for the build is located under the docs directory and can be accessed locally using the follow command in the terminal:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint source lang-shell"><code>npx serve docs
</code></pre>
<p>The local live server link to the documentation will be located at:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint source lang-shell"><code>http://localhost:3000/
</code></pre>
<p>Documentation for cross pod components has yet to be documented.</p>
<h2>How to get this running locally</h2>
<p>To get a running version of this branch, clone from this branch into a directory and run the following within the directory containing the package.json:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint source lang-shell"><code>npm install
</code></pre>
<p>After installing the dependencies from package.json, run the following to start a local live server to view the application:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint source lang-shell"><code>npx parcel ./src/index.html
</code></pre>
<p>The local live server would be located in port 1234:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint source lang-shell"><code>http://localhost:1234/
</code></pre>
<p>Latest version of this build require users to login to their Pod through <a href="https://opencommons.net">https://opencommons.net</a></p></article>
